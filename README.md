# cao_python_workshop
This repository contains the exercise notebook used in the "Programming with Python" session I led as part of the CAO Programming Workshop at the University of Limerick for high school students.  The notebook is designed to introduce students to Python programming in a fun and beginner-friendly way. 
It builds up from simple concepts to a mini-project and concludes with basic data analysis and visualization using Pandas.
